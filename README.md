# predictive-maintenance
Predictive maintenance and anomaly detection in computer systems using Elastic Stack and ML (Decision Tree + Random Forest) with real-time metric ingestion and Kibana visualization. Six classifiers were tested, including Random Forest, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression, Naïve Bayes, and K-Nearest Neighbors. Although Random Forest and Decision Tree classifiers achieved 100% accuracy on test data, making them more reliable and adaptive models for predictive maintenance using statistical methods, such as z-score and interquartile range. This approach shall enforce system reliability and cybersecurity, reduce equipment disruptions, and save costs, improving the efficiency and availability of computer systems
